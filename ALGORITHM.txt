       
1.  Creating a Hash Map of size 18.
   - Each pair represents a k-value relationship in a special list called a hash map.

2. **Filling the Hash Map:**
   - Go through each pair in the grid and create a hash map where the k is the first number, and the value is an object with two properties (i and j) representing the pair.

3. **Displaying Images:**
   - Now, let's visualize these pairs with images in a game.
   - Think of each pair as hiding behind two pokeballs initially.

4. **Shuffling Images:**
   - Shuffle the pokeballs randomly so the images are in a different order each time you play.

5. **Playing the Game:**
   - Every time you click on a pokeball, it reveals an image.
   - The goal is to find matching pairs by clicking on two different pokeballs.

6. **Checking for Matches:**
   - When two images are revealed, the game checks if they form a matching pair based on the original grid.

7. **Scoring:**
   - If you find a matching pair, your score increases.
   - The game continues until you find all pairs.

8. **Winning the Game:**
   - Once all pairs are found, you win the game!

9. **Summary:**
   - The game is about memory and strategy.
   - Click on pokeballs to reveal hidden images and match pairs.
   - Keep track of your clicks and score.
   - Challenge yourself to find all pairs and win the game!

1. we create an object that contains 2 maped integers, such that the 2nd integer is = first integer + 18.
2.
